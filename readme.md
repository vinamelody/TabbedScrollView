# Hi, my name is Vina 👩🏻‍💻

I have a ZStack containing 2 tabs where each has a scrollview, switching between tabs makes the content jumps. I use a trick that I learn from [John Sundel's article here](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/observing-swiftui-scrollview-content-offset/).

Please check out the previews for ContentView to reproduce the issue.

Thanks for looking! 🫶🏻
